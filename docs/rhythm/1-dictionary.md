**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-22  
**Status:** Initial Draft - For Review

This dictionary defines key terms and concepts used throughout RHYTHM Method documentation.

## Core Concepts

### Agent

An AI system capable of performing development tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. Agents can be specialized (Backend Agent, Frontend Agent, QA Agent, etc.) or general ([RHYTHM Agent](#rhythm-agent)).

### Agentic Development Environment (ADE)

A development environment where [AI agents](#agent) perform development work, either autonomously or in coordination with humans.

### Bug

A defect or issue that needs to be fixed. In RHYTHM Method, Bugs must be [**parented**](#parented) to a [Work Unit](#work-unit) (bug found during development) or [**related**](#related) to a [Feature](#feature) (bug found in production).

### Dependency

A relationship where one work item requires another to be completed first. Dependencies can be technical (code, API, infrastructure), data (database schema), integration (external services), or knowledge (domain understanding).

### Dependency-Driven Prioritization

A mandatory prioritization rule in RHYTHM Method where work is ordered by [dependency graph](#dependency-graph) first, then by business value within the same dependency level. [Dependencies](#dependency) must be resolved before dependent work can begin.

### Project Manifest

The top-level container for all [Features](#feature) in a RHYTHM Method project. The Project Manifest replaces Epics from traditional product management processes and replaces Constitution files from [Spec-Driven Development](#spec-driven-development-sdd). Unlike Epics (which are optional and can be multiple), a Project Manifest is mandatory and there is only one per project. The Project Manifest serves three roles: (1) top-level container for all Features, (2) project information repository (similar to Constitutions in SDD), and (3) decision log tracking architectural decisions and requirement changes (similar to ADRs). This creates a single source of truth that both [Users](#user) and [Agents](#agent) can reference to understand project requirements and their evolution.

### Execution Cycle

A focused work period in RHYTHM Method, typically 2-8 hours, that replaces traditional 2-week sprints. Execution cycles focus on single [features](#feature), [dependency](#dependency) chains, or project objectives and result in deployed, tested, validated code.

### Feature

A required deliverable unit of functionality that provides business value. Features must contain [Work Units](#work-unit), can be deployed independently, and have clear validation criteria.

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

The integration of human oversight, decision-making, and validation at critical points in the development process. HITL ensures humans provide strategic input, validate [specifications](#specification), and approve major decisions while [agents](#agent) handle execution.

### RHYTHM Agent

A specialized [agent](#agent) responsible for coordination, prioritization, and [user](#user) management in RHYTHM Method. The RHYTHM Agent replaces the traditional Project Manager Agent for [agentic development environments](#agentic-development-environment-ade).

### RHYTHM Method

**R**apid, **H**igh-**Y**ield, **T**oken-based, **H**uman-in-loop, **M**anagement - A project management methodology specifically designed for [agents](#agent) with human integration. RHYTHM Method adapts proven principles from Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and [Spec-Driven Development](#spec-driven-development-sdd) for AI [agent](#agent) teams.

### Scope Creep

The uncontrolled expansion of project scope beyond original requirements. RHYTHM Method prevents scope creep by distinguishing between bugs (fix in current work) and new requests (create new [Work Unit](#work-unit)).

### Specification

A detailed, structured document that acts as a contract defining what will be built. Specifications include system behavior, constraints, interfaces, and test expectations. In RHYTHM Method, specifications are created before implementation and validated by [users](#user).

### Agent Task

The smallest unit of executable work in RHYTHM Method. Agent Tasks must belong to a [Work Unit](#work-unit), can be completed by a single [agent](#agent), typically take 30 minutes to 2 hours, and have clear completion criteria.

### TEMPO

A concept within RHYTHM Method describing the **speed/pace at which agents operate**. [Agents](#agent) work at fast computational speeds (hours, not weeks), but [RHYTHM](#rhythm) ensures control, flow, and [HITL](#human-in-the-loop-hitl) integration.

### Token

A unit of measurement used in RHYTHM Method for estimation. Tokens represent code generation, analysis, documentation, and validation work. [Token estimation](#token-estimation) replaces abstract story points with precise, measurable factors.

### Token Estimation

A precise estimation method in RHYTHM Method that calculates work based on measurable factors ([tokens](#token)) rather than abstract concepts (story points). Token estimates account for code generation, analysis, documentation, and validation.

### User

The human stakeholder who provides requirements, validates [specifications](#specification), makes strategic decisions, and approves deliverables. In RHYTHM Method, "User" replaces traditional terms like "customer" or "stakeholder" to emphasize the [Human-in-the-Loop](#human-in-the-loop-hitl) relationship.

### Work Unit

A required agentic-specific term for a specific piece of work that can be completed in a single [execution cycle](#execution-cycle). Work Units must belong to a [Feature](#feature), contain [Agent Tasks](#agent-task), and are the atomic unit of work assignment to specialized [agents](#agent).

## Methodology Terms

### Continuous Execution Model

An execution model in RHYTHM Method where work happens continuously without discrete sprints. [Agents](#agent) pull work from a prioritized queue, work in parallel, and deploy when validated.

### Dependency Graph

A real-time visualization of all [dependencies](#dependency) between [work units](#work-unit). The dependency graph is automatically maintained and used for [prioritization](#dependency-driven-prioritization) and critical path identification.

### Quality Gate

An automated checkpoint where code, tests, and [specifications](#specification) are validated. Quality gates may also include [Human-in-the-Loop](#human-in-the-loop-hitl) review and approval at critical milestones.

### Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

A development methodology where detailed, structured [specifications](#specification) act as contracts between [agents](#agent), [users](#user), and the system. All work begins with comprehensive specifications that are validated before implementation.

**Note:** RHYTHM Method is an alternative to SDD, not a modification of it. RHYTHM Method can incorporate SDD principles but is designed specifically for agents with human integration.

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

The hierarchical structure for organizing work in RHYTHM Method: [Project Manifest](#project-manifest) → [Features](#feature) → [Work Units](#work-unit) → [Agent Tasks](#agent-task).

## Process Terms

### Continuous Planning

A planning approach in RHYTHM Method where plans are continuously updated based on real-time information, rather than being fixed for sprint durations.

### Dynamic Replanning

The ability to instantly replan when priorities or [dependencies](#dependency) change, without the overhead of meetings or coordination that makes replanning costly for human teams.

### Living Documents

Documents that are automatically maintained and updated as work progresses. [Specifications](#specification), roadmaps, and plans are living documents in RHYTHM Method, staying current without manual maintenance.

### Real-Time Visibility

Complete visibility into all work, progress, and decisions in real-time through automated dashboards, rather than periodic status updates or meetings.

## Agent Terms

### Agent Capacity

The maximum amount of work an [agent](#agent) can handle, based on [throughput rate](#token-throughput-rate) ([tokens](#token) per hour), parallel task limits, and [specialization](#agent-specialization).

### Agent Coordination

The process by which multiple specialized [agents](#agent) work together on complex tasks, coordinating through structured interfaces and shared context.

### Agent Specialization

The focus of an [agent](#agent) on a specific domain (Backend, Frontend, DevOps, QA, etc.). Specialized agents have deep expertise in their domain.

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

The coordination of multiple specialized [agents](#agent) working together on complex tasks, enabled by structured interfaces and shared context.

## Estimation Terms

### Token Throughput Rate

The rate at which an [agent](#agent) processes [tokens](#token), measured in tokens per hour. Throughput rates vary by agent capability and task complexity.

### Token Count

The total number of [tokens](#token) required for a [work unit](#work-unit), calculated as: Code Tokens + Analysis Tokens + Documentation Tokens + Validation Tokens.

### Roll-Up Estimation

The process of aggregating estimates from lower levels to higher levels in the [WBS](#work-breakdown-structure-wbs) hierarchy ([Agent Task](#agent-task) → [Work Unit](#work-unit) → [Feature](#feature) → [Project Manifest](#project-manifest)).

## Work Item Relationships

### Parented

A relationship where a child [work unit](#work-unit) belongs to a parent. For example, [Bugs](#bug) are parented to [Work Units](#work-unit) (bugs found during development).

### Related

A relationship where [work units](#work-unit) are connected but not in a parent-child hierarchy. For example, [Bugs](#bug) are related to [Features](#feature) (bugs found in production).

### Dependency

See **Dependency** in Core Concepts section.

## Music Metaphor Terms

### TEMPO

The speed/pace at which agents operate (fast computational speeds). See **TEMPO** in Core Concepts section.

### RHYTHM

The control, flow, and coordination that ensures quality and alignment. RHYTHM ensures that fast [TEMPO](#tempo) is controlled and coordinated through [dependency-driven prioritization](#dependency-driven-prioritization), [Human-in-the-Loop](#human-in-the-loop-hitl) checkpoints, and [multi-agent collaboration](#multi-agent-collaboration).
